# Database Migrations Guide

This document explains how database migrations work in the DOU Jobs Scraper project.

## üéØ Automatic Migrations (Production)

**Good news:** Migrations happen automatically on every deployment!

### How It Works

When you deploy to production (via Coolify):

1. Coolify pulls your latest code from GitHub
2. Docker Compose starts the services in this order:
   - ‚úÖ `postgres` starts and becomes healthy
   - ‚úÖ `migrate` runs `prisma db push` (applies schema changes)
   - ‚úÖ `bot` starts only after migrations complete successfully

### What This Means

- **No manual commands needed** - migrations run automatically
- **Safe deployments** - bot won't start with outdated schema
- **Always up-to-date** - database schema matches your code
- **Path-independent** - works regardless of where Coolify stores your project

## üìã Docker Compose Configuration

The magic happens in `docker/prod/docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  migrate:
    build:
      dockerfile: docker/prod/Dockerfile.migrate
    restart: "no"  # Run once and exit
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy

  bot:
    depends_on:
      migrate:
        condition: service_completed_successfully  # Wait for migrations
```

## üõ† Manual Migration Commands

### Production

If you ever need to run migrations manually:

```bash
# SSH into your VPS
ssh user@your-vps-ip

# Navigate to project (Coolify typically uses /data/coolify/applications/YOUR_APP_ID)
cd /data/coolify/applications/YOUR_APP_ID

# Run migrations
docker compose run --rm migrate

# Or view migration logs
docker compose logs migrate
```

### Development

For local development:

```bash
cd docker/dev
docker compose run --rm bot npm run -w @repo/database db:push
```

## üìù Migration Files

### Dockerfile.migrate

Located at `docker/prod/Dockerfile.migrate`:

- Minimal Node.js Alpine image
- Installs only what's needed for Prisma
- Runs `npm run db:push` by default

### Prisma Schema

The schema is located at `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`

When you change the schema:
1. Test locally first
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Coolify automatically deploys and runs migrations
4. Done! üéâ

## üîç Checking Migration Status

### View Migration Logs

```bash
# View recent migration logs
docker compose logs migrate

# Follow migration logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f migrate
```

### Check Database Schema

```bash
# Connect to database
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d dou_jobs

# List all tables
\dt

# Describe a specific table
\d jobs

# Exit
\q
```

## üß™ Testing Migrations Locally

Before deploying, test your migration locally:

```bash
# 1. Update your schema in packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma

# 2. Build and run locally
cd docker/prod
docker compose build migrate
docker compose run --rm migrate

# 3. Check if it worked
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d dou_jobs
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Migration Failed

If migration fails, the bot won't start (which is good - prevents issues).

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs migrate
```

**Common issues:**

1. **Database connection error**
   - Check `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables
   - Ensure postgres is running: `docker compose ps postgres`

2. **Schema syntax error**
   - Review your Prisma schema
   - Test locally before deploying

3. **Incompatible change**
   - Prisma `db:push` works for most changes
   - For complex migrations, you might need `prisma migrate`

### Rollback Strategy

If deployment fails due to migration issues:

1. **Quick fix**: Revert your code changes
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```
   Coolify will auto-deploy the previous version

2. **Manual fix**: Fix the schema and redeploy
   ```bash
   # Fix schema.prisma
   git add packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma
   git commit -m "Fix migration issue"
   git push
   ```

## üîê Best Practices

1. **Test locally first** - Always test schema changes in development
2. **Small changes** - Make incremental schema changes
3. **Backup before major changes** - Create database backup before significant migrations
4. **Monitor logs** - Check migration logs after deployment
5. **Use db:push for development** - Quick and easy for prototyping
6. **Consider migrate for production** - For complex changes or team environments

## üí° Why db:push Instead of migrate?

We use `prisma db push` instead of `prisma migrate` because:

- ‚úÖ **Simpler** - No migration files to manage
- ‚úÖ **Faster** - Direct schema sync
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for small teams/solo projects**
- ‚úÖ **Works great with Prisma's schema-first approach

For larger teams or complex migrations, consider switching to `prisma migrate`.
